            <h3>How does this happen?</h3>
            <p>Just like any other living thing, Clover is able to contract diseases and be brought into life with mutations. Often with a mutation, itâ€™s a hereditary gene, passed all throughout the plant. Mutations hardly do any long lasting harm. Diseases are a bit harsher. If one plant has a form of pestilence that may be able to spread through roots, soil, leaves, or pollen. They can become sick from bacteria, viruses, insects, parasites, or even just a lack of an element of survival. </p>
