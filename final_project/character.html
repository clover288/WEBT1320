            <p>Charlotte "Charlie" Morningstar is the main character in the musical animated series Hazbin Hotel. She is the princess of Hell, the founder of the Happy Hotel, and the daughter of Lucifer Morningstar and Lilith. Charlie's powers include demon transformation and she tries to reform sinners. Her goal is to redeem the patrons of her hotel so they can go to Heaven. Alastor helps Charlie rehabilitate monsters, but their motivations differ. Charlie seeks redemption for the underworld's inhabitants, whereas Alastor primarily pursues his own interests. 
                Charlie's powers are not as strong as some of the other characters in the show, such as Alastor or Angel Dust. However, she is still a valuable asset to the team.</p>
