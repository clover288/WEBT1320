        <h2>How Clover Helps in Our Ecosystem
        </h2>
        <img src="flowerbee.jpeg">
        <p>Clover, though considered a weed, helps a great deal in supporting our ecosystem. Clover is a small, three leafed plant that grows in patches in almost a viney way. It produces flowers that help bees pollinate all of the other plants. The majority of small omnivoris mammals eat is as a source of nutrients. </p>

        <h2>Mutations</h2>
        <img src="4leafclover.jpeg">
        <p>There are genetic mutations that can make clover change its appearance. The two most common ones you'll see are four leafed clovers, and white leaves. The Four leafed clovers come from a genetic mutation known as Trifolium Repens. It is a recessive gene thats only found in white flower clovers. When a clover has white or yellow patches on their leaves, thats a sign of Chlorosis. Chlorosis is the absence of Chlorophyll in plants, which is what causes the green color. Neither of these mutations are harmful, just a small abnormity in our lovely world. </p>
